Take me back To the place that feels like home To the people I can depend on To the faith thats in my bones Take me back To a preacher and a verse Where theyve seen me at my worst To the love I had at first Oh I want to go to church I want to go to church Oh more than an obligation Its our foundation The family of God I know its hard But. Oh Quiero ir a la iglesia.</p>
