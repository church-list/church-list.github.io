<p>171 likes 4 talking about this. From First Colony Church of Christ. To be candid I have been a member there for many years and am a better person a better husband a better dad a better friend. We spent 11 wonderful years there planting churches and training church leaders. From there I first began serving at First Colony in 1996 when my wife Carole and I were members of the Ankole Mission Team that the church sent to Uganda East Africa.</p>
