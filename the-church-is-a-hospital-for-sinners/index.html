<p>Church a Hospital for Sinners. The Church A Hospital for Sinners. The church is a hospital for sinners that might ideally be run by saints but thats a rarity. Prayer is warfare to the last breath. The church whether you mean the Body of Christ or more specifically the church service is not a Hospital for sinners and it is indeed more of a Club for saints.</p>

<p>Ive heard it before in various ways at various times and Ive never given it much thought. Oftentimes people throw this one liner out to lessen their personal responsibility for error. Its where Christians have their fellowship and restoration when they backslide so they can continue to grow in grace. The purpose of church like a hospital is to save lives. The church is not a hotel for saints it is a hospital for sinners- Saint Augustine.</p>

<p>The church is a hospital for sinners that might ideally be run by saints but thats a rarity. In the Church the joyful sustain their joy. The church is a hospital for sinners not a museum for saints attributed to Augustine of Hippo John Chrysostom and Abigail Van Buren among others. The church should be a hospital for sinners. I read that phrase a few days ago on social media and it struck me in the gut.</p>
