Too dangerous to keep Too feeble to let go And you want to bite the hand Shoulda stopped this long ago Go now youve been set free Another month or so youll be gorging on me With your lovely smile I see you slither away with your skin and your tail. Go now youve been set free. You can bark but there aint much bite. Another month or so youll be poisoning me With your lovely smile.</p>
