<p>How many people will be in your group. Meeting at Temple Baptist Church in Fargo ND. This is a bit longer than most churches but we place paramount importance on the in-depth teaching of Gods Word thus requiring a full hour being devoted to the scriptures. We study the scriptures from a historical grammatical literal and contextual perspective to discern what the scriptures mean by what they say. We believe that the Bible contains all the answers necessary to receive eternal life to know God and to live life.</p>
