<p>Is how he put that Church back on the narrow way With a half crazed Mississippi squirrel The day the squirrel went berserk In the First Self-Righteous Church In the sleepy little town of Pascagoula It was a fight for survival that broke out in revival They was jumpin pews and shoutin Hallelujah. The Day The Squirrel Went To Church. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves. That morning another squirrel had decided to hang out in the cage. After much prayer and consideration they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldnt interfere with Gods divine will.</p>

<p>A squirrel got loose Sunday in an Alabama church and the pastors reaction was captured on video. The Day The Squirrel Went To Church. When the squirrel escapes his box it heads into the overalls of one of the other parishioners who jumps in shock and discomfort thinking he had a Weed Eater loose in his Fruit of the Looms. It was a fight for survival that broke out. The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation.</p>
