<p>Lyrics submitted by SongMeanings. Its an upbeat song about a guy who has played all night and is now late for his own wedding. It was originally recorded by Shenandoah. Just about a mile off-a one-oh-nine Theres a little church sittin back in the pines. I promised that girl she was gonna be mine.</p>
