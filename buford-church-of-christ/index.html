<p>The services are composed of the preaching of Gods Word a reading from the Bible time for reflection prayer and congregational acapella singing to exalt the glory of God. When the apostle Paul heard the gospel through Ananias something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained sight. Through the efforts of Reynaldo and the congregation the church has grown both spiritually and numerically. We offer many opportunities for men to come together for Bible study and fellowship.
