<p>We use the Hebrew Name of God YHWH YHWSH and our plan of salvation is the same plan Peter laid out at Pentecost in Acts 238. The man was AG. This truth is a distinguishing mark between Gods church built on a rock and the nominal adventist churches built on sand. It was a verse I had been drawn to for many years so I was excited to see that we had a similar scope of doctrinal interests and had the same interpretation of the key doctrine at hand. Church at 909 Farm to Market Road 1518 Schertz TX 78154.</p>
