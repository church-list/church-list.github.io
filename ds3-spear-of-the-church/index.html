<p>-You want to maximize your resistances and health. Boy oh boy did FromSoftware treat us with some great boss fights in the latest Dark Souls 3 DLC. The player must have defeated Darkeater Midir and acquired the Spears of the Church covenant item. Favorite Spear of the Church Builds. Even if you win you are.</p>

<p>What a wonderful blessed day this is. They had the opportunity to create an actual boss like vordt or champion or pontiff ect but instead of doing that and putting you know effort into it they chose to get a generic NPC boost their health up a bit and their poise to a ridiculous degree and spawn random painted guardians also with ridiculous poise for no explained. Unfortunately my successful Blue Sentinel build is struggling as a Spear of the Church. Favorite Spear of the Church Builds. May thy travels be resplendent with glory.</p>
