<p>After beating Blood Starved Beast go back to Cathedral Ward up the elevator across the bridge with the wheelchair snipers and go all the way to the top of that tower. The key to that door can be found after you defeat Rom the Vacuous Spider in Byrgenwerth and gain access to Yahargul Unseen VillageOnce youve explored the Unseen Village and gained access to the Yahargul Chapel lamp you. To find the upper cathedral key one needs to go to lamp. From the lamp in Cathedral Ward head right to the door that was locked before you took on the Blood-starved Beast which will now be open. Heal after landing and fall down on the board in front of the door.</p>
