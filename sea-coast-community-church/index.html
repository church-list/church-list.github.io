<p>What to Expect at Seacoast Community Church in Encinitas CA 92024. Helping people discover life in Jesus and teaching them to follow Him. After church hunting for quite awhile we realized that something kept drawing us back to Seacoast Community Church. The lunch is covered by the churchs tax-exempt 501c3 status and its finances are entirely separate from other church funds. Grace and blessings to you and to you.</p>
