<p>On Easter Sunday April 4 2021 worshipers attending the Church at Brook Hills in person or watching online experienced a call to change their hearts from sinful ways and find joy in Christ. The Emmanuel Church at Brook Hill in the historic community of Brook Hill in Henrico County Virginia is a historic Episcopal church. On Easter Sunday April 4 2021 worshipers attending the Church at Brook Hills in person or watching online experienced a call to change their hearts from sinful ways and find joy in Christ. This coming weekend our church fellowship will be teaming with a group for The Church at Brook Hills to conduct a backyard Bible club event that we are calling Rock the Block. We hope youll join us as we study what Gods Word teaches us regarding image-bearers with special needs.</p>
