<p>Young Grass Dew Locations. Im not a great pvp player so when I put on the covenant item I didnt expect too much but the utility granted to you by that stupid ritual spear fragment the auto shots over your head and the healing from the guardians makes it almost impossible to lose. While a member of the Covenant players wearing this Covenant badge will be summoned to become Halflight Spear of the Church during the boss fight.
