Weve made our choice Let the anthems ring out songs of victory swell For the church triumphant is alive and well You know this ships been through battles before The storms and the tempests and all the rocks on the shore Though the hull may be battered Inside its safe and dry It. SONGLYRICS just got interactive.</p>

<p>While In Afflictions Furnace And Passing Through The Fire Thy Love We Praise Which Knows Our Days. 2 Thee in thy glorious realm they praise And bow before thy throne. All content belongs to its rightful ownersNot for monetary gain. Swell the chorus never ending Worthy the Lamb. Thrones and powrs before Him bending Odors sweet with voice ascending.</p>

<p>Every Kindred Tongue And Nation Worthy The Lamb. Swell the chorus never ending Worthy the Lamb. 3 The holy to the holiest leads From hence our spirits rise And he that in thy statutes treads. Head Of Thy Church Triumphant We Joyfully Adore Thee. Tis the Church triumphant singing Worthy the Lamb.</p>
