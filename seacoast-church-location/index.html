<p>Salaries posted anonymously by Seacoast Church employees in Mount Pleasant SC. 14 locations throughout SC NC. I highly recommend working for Seacoast Church. Mount Pleasant Campus I grew up going to church on occasion but never understood why. Southeastern University in Lakeland Florida partners with Seacoast Church to host an instructional site on the church campus.</p>
