Little did I know at the age of nine 1972 that when my parents attended Grand Avenue Baptist Church in Hot Springs Arkansas it would be a watershed moment for our entire family. Grand Avenue Baptist Church. The pastor is friendly and the Bible is preached according with the scriptures But lately there has been disruptions during the message by a child causing myself and my friend to lose parts of the message due to these uncontrolled outbursts. 479 783-5161 3900 Grand Avenue Fort Smith AR 72904.</p>
