<p>70 reviews of Church by the Glades Big. He has been part of a church resurrection seeing a declining congregation of less than 500 soar to over 9000 in average worship attendance. I would recommend it to all my friends. Along with prayer support and biblical guidance offered by our pastors and staff Church by the Glades offers Christian counseling through licensed professional counselors on-site and off by referral. CBG is fearlessly led by Pastor David Hughes.</p>
