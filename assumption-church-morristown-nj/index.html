<p>Located in Morris County. See reviews photos directions phone numbers and more for Assumption Catholic Church locations in Morristown NJ. The Mission of the Catholic Community of The Church of the Assumption is to be led by the Word of God to proclaim God in our words and actions and to follow the example of Mary our Mother in leading all people to God. In 1875 that parcel of land was a full tract of land consisting of approximately 15 acres fronting Whippany Road. We believe that Jesus Christ breathes His Spirit on us so that we can strive to become a more perfect expression of the Good News in all aspects of everyday life.</p>
