<p>In the spring of the year 2000 I attended an Easter Sunday morning service hosted by Rocky Mountain Calvary Chapel at Sky Sox Stadium which has since been renamed here in Colorado Springs. Based in Colorado Springs Colo the church provides a range of ministries for adults men women student as well as children. I liked the detailed Scriptural teachings of the Calvary Chapel churches and wanted to get away from the unbiblical emotionally-driven motivational speeches. They teach verse by verse from the Bible and nothing else. El Paso County Colorado 80903-Children Served.</p>
