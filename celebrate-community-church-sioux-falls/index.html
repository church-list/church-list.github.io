<p>Welcome Home is a phrase that we use often. Celebrate Church exists because we want people to MEET JESUS. Regardless of where youve been what youve done or what you are currently struggling with you are welcome and wanted at Celebrate Church. Join us Sundays at 8AM 10AM 7PM. This is the vision of Celebrate Church led by our Founding Senior Pastor Keith Loy and based in Sioux Falls SD.</p>

<p>We are less a building and more a community. Jesus told a simple story of a lost son - a prodigal - who wasted his life on wild living. We are less a building and more a community. We meet at 11 on Sunday mornings at 1525 South Ave West. Welcome Home is a phrase that we use often.</p>
