<p>Ive attended several megachurches in the past but this is by far the. Sunday Service at Central Christian Church Henderson Nevada. Being a member of a church of 470 meeting on weekends to a church responsible for having 70000 attend at special events is quite an experience. Central has a casual dress code and a radical grace atmosphere where everyone is accepted no matter what they have done or where they have been. Life can be scary but we can face our fears with faith.</p>
