<p>Founded in 1980 Living Word is a Bible-based Spirit-empowered and growing church. The name was changed to Living Word Christian Center in 1990. The doors opened at 6 PM sharp and no more than 30 minutes later the spacious auditorium was filled to capacity with people waiting. Still living in Minnesota they traveled to Chicago on weekends to hold two-day Faith Crusades where the crowds would sometimes average less. Living Word is a church with a heart for our community and desire to see people everywhere know the person of Jesus in a personal and authentic way.</p>
