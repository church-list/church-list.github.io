<p>With a vision to reach and transform the lives of the community Compass Christian Church has expanded its 253-acre campus. We believe that Christ is the Head of His Church and therefore every Christian is a part of His body. Over the last several years the Lord has been working in and through our church is some pretty amazing ways that led us to a crossroads. When Pastor Roger Storms retired I was sad to see him go but Pastor Brian Jobe has done a terrific job stepping in. Join us Sundays 9 11 am.</p>
