<p>Organized more than 100 years ago under a brush arbor the McKinney First Baptist Church has a rich heritage of faith and progress. The sudden influx of new believers encouraged a heart for missions to reach the lost. We believe that our outstanding program and staff are built on a solid foundation of excellence that has been represented by more than 40 years of educational service to the McKinney community. More than 100 of those new believers joined First McKinney and the church more than doubled in size. Land at this site was deeded to church trustees in 1893 by TJ. The church was organized in 1882 by Rev.</p>
