<p>My new favorite VPN service. Founded in 1828 Grace Church has been the Episcopal presence in Gainesville Georgia for over 180 years. Take I-85 north to I-985 north. The parish office open Monday through Thursday from 1000 AM 400 PM is located at 422 Brenau Avenue. From small and humble beginnings we have grown into a large and vibrant congregation of about 900 members centered on worship formation and service.</p>
