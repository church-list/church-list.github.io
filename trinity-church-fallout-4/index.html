<p>The area known as Trinity Plaza is a church ruins Location in the central area of The Commonwealth. In the game Trinity Plaza is composed of three landmarks. Ive seen a few scattered reports of this and I just want to note that the radiant quest to clear Super Mutants at Trinity Plaza seems to be bugged. The obvious problem is that the game assigns no. You must reach it.</p>
