The house owned by Asa Brown was moved it to its current location on County Road in 1837 so that the South Congregational Church could be built facing the South Green on a lot west of the Heard mansion now the Ipswich Museum. The original South Church meeting house was replaced by a fine sanctuary in 1838.</p>
