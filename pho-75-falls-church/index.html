<p>Restaurant menu map for Pho 75 Pho Seventy-Five located in 22042 Falls Church VA 3103 Graham Rd. Pho 75 is chain of restaurants that serve pho Vietnamese beef noodle soup in the Washington DC. The service is fast here so dont be surprised the moment you sit down- they will be ready to take your order. Recently I got pho to go and the broth was slightly watered down and didnt pack the same punch. Also - they only accept cash so stop by an ATM first.</p>
