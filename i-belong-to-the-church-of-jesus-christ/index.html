Finally i finished my first pro.</p>

<p>It is therefore very important to God. When we belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints it doesnt matter where we live what language we speak or what kind of building we meet in because we all believe the same important principles. I know Gods plan. His truth I will proclaim. I believe in the Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
