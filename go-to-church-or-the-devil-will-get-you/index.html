<p>Church attendance does not insure our right standing with God. It is the best gift for you your friends and your family as well. It apparently has displayed the devil in his red suit for years. He did the same on his wifes podcast and he has just never really stopped. In other words you can go to church and the devil can still get you or you can stay away from church and not be gotten by the devil.</p>
